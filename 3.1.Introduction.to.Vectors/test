At the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

* Create a vector using the `c()` function with or without names
* Add names to a vector using the `names()` function
* Access and change the names of a vector using the `names()` function
* Create a sequence 
* Add elements to the start and end of a vector

## 3.1.2: Vector Creation

---

A scientist is measuring the growth of wild-type (no mutations) E. coli in three conditions:
1. in the presence of the antibiotic kanamycin
2. in the presence of the antibiotic ampicillin
3. in the presence of no antibiotics

They measure the optical density (OD) after 24 hours to assess the growth. (Higher OD - more E. coli.)

Three replicates of wild-type E. coli after 24 hours in the presence of no antibiotics had the following ODs:

| 1.32 | 1.02 | 1.48 |

Create a vector of the OD measurements after 24 in the presence of no antibiotics called "no_antibiotic_OD". 
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.2.a.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Add names to the `no_antibiotic_OD` vector according to the following table:

|    | rep_1 | rep_2 | rep_3 |
| OD | 1.32  | 1.02  | 1.48  |
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.2.b.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Three replicates of wild-type E. coli after 24 hours in the presence of *kanamycin* had the following ODs:

|    | rep_1 | rep_2 | rep_3 |
| OD | 0.05  | 0.01  | 0.03  | 

Three replicates of wild-type E. coli after 24 hours in the presence of *ampicillin* had the following ODs:

|    | rep_1 | rep_2 | rep_3 |
| OD | 0.02  | 0.01  | 0.04  |

Create a SINGLE vector of the OD measurements after 24 in the presence of kanamycin and ampicillin called "antibiotic_OD". During creation of the vector add a name to each element to match the names in the tables. 

Be sure to add the kanamycin replications before the ampicillin replicates, and to add the values in the same order as they are in the tables.
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.2.c.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

The names in this vector are not unique. Assign new names to the vector so that the the names of the replicates grown in the presence of kanamycin start with "kan_" (ex. "kan_rep_1") and the names of the replicates grown in the presence of ampicillin start with "amp_" (ex. "amp_rep_1")
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.2.d.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block**

## 3.1.3: Sequences & Adding Elements

---

The scientist performed a fourth replicate for the E. coli grown in the presence of no antibiotics. The OD measurement after 24 hours was 1.71. Add this value with an appropriate name to the vector `no_antibiotic_OD`. 
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.a.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

A week later the scientist did two more replicates (5th and 6th) in the presence of no antibiotics. The OD measurements were:

| 1.23 | 1.45 |

Create a new vector (with named elements) containing these two measurements. Call it "no_antibiotic_OD_new_reps".
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.b.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Use the combine function to add the new vector: `no_antibiotic_OD_new_reps` to the end of `no_antibiotic_OD`.
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.c.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Create a sequence that counts down from 7 to 0. Assign it to a variable named "seven_to_zero".
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.d.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Create a sequence vector named "negative_three_to_zero", that contains the integers from -3 increasing to 0.
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.e.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Create a sequence vector named "one_to_three", that contains the integers from 1 increasing to 3.
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.f.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Combine the previous two vectors to create a new vector that contains the integers from -3 increasing to 3. Name the vector "negative_three_to_three".
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.g.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block** 

Use the vector `negative_three_to_three` to create a new vector called `negative_four_to_four`, by using the `c()` function to add a -4 to the beginning and a 4 to the end.
```{r}
# Write and execute your code here

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/Tutorial.W3.1.3.h.R")
```
**Check your answer by running the above block**
